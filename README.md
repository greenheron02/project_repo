This repository is for storing the files of the Charger Arcade Terminals project of UAH CPE Senior Design Group 22

In the UAH CPE 353 and CS 347 classes, student games do not easily escape the scope of the class. The UAH Charger Arcade Terminal allows users to play student-created games in a single-player or multiplayer mode with up to four other arcade terminals. Terminal users can play from a pre-selected list of games, or load up to four games themselves. Terminals feature information regarding the gameâ€™s creator(s) such as emails, GitHub/GitLab pages, date of creation, and social media, in order to provide a point where UAH students are able to network with interested individuals.

See the G22_Install_Instructions for instructions on how to implement the system on a new computer
