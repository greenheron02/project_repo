Any .png files in this folder will be loaded into the level select in VS mode.
You can edit them in the in-game editor, or you could just open them up in MsPaint or Photoshop and manipulate them that way.

Solid black pixels will be left as empty black background. Whilst any other colour will become a block of some kind. Specific colours will become specific blocks, like goals. The easiest way to get the right block colours would be to load an existing level and copy the colours from that.
